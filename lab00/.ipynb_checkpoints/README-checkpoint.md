# Lab 00: Preliminaries

Welcome to **CS 331: Data Structures and Algorithms**!

## Exercise 1

Each lab notebook will contain one or more coding exercises followed by tests. Your job is to complete these exercises — adhering to any criteria given — such that they pass all the tests. Additional tests may also be run when you submit the notebook for grading. Your score is typically available immediately, and you may resubmit your work as many times as you wish (with a 5-minute cooldown period) before the deadline.

Because we haven't gone over any Python syntax in class yet, we'll keep this exercise really simple. To complete this exercise, change the body of the following function so that it returns a palindrome — a string that reads the same backwards as forwards — of your choice. The palindrome has to be at least 2 letters long!

```python
def my_palindrome():
    return ''
```

After completing the implementation, you can run test your application by running from a terminal in this folder:

```shell
python lab00.py
```

If all tests pass, you'll see a confirmation that your implementation returns a palindrome. Otherwise, check out the error shown, fix your implementation, and run the test cell again.

```
$python lab00.py
your successfully created a palindrome!
```
